Fonts
----------------------------
look at /etc/X11/xinitrc.d/xft-settings.sh for why ui/text is so tiny on startup


Wifi
----------------------------
if you have problems connecting to wifi, try:
  $ sudo ip link set wlp2s0 down
  $ sudo wifi-menu

also, from archlinux forums:
  "For me the problem was that netctl-ifplugd@eth0.service had control of the
   interface, which is why it would constantly switch it to UP.
   My solution was:
     $ systemctl disable netctl-ifplugd@eth0.service
   After that netcl start worked just fine. Of course this will impact auto
   profile switching."
